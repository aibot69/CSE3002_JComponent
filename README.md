# Library Self Check-in System
This repository is made as a project for the subject Internet and Web Programming for the semester Winter Semester 2020-21 in VIT Vellore.

## Overview
This project is created to automate the process of borrowing books from a library from anywhere and enabling the user to either borrow the book easily without any check-out process, similar to how online check-in works for flights. The difference in concept here is that people can check the availability of books beforehand and book them for picking up later.

## How to run project
1. Open a command prompt or bash shell.
2. Give the following command.
```
git clone https://github.com/aibot69/CSE3002_JComponent
```
3. If you have XAMPP or WAMP installed, move the folder where you can run PHP, otherwise download PHP from [here](https://www.php.net/downloads.php).
4. Open a terminal inside the folder.
5. Type in `php -S localhost:8080` and open [this](localhost:8080) to run the website on port 8080 in your localhost.
